## Title
Signed message

## Description
You know what a great joke it would be?  
It would be a great joke if we made a task about minecraft.  
And named it "Signed message", so people would think it's something about certificates or cryptography.  
But instead made it something completely different.  
Yeah, that would be a great joke...
