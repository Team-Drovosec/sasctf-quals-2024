## Title
Turing's gold nugget

## Description
Once upon a time there lived a great programmer.
Perhaps the best programmer out there.
The code he wrote was so eloquent yet so simple.
Not only his programs ran fast, but you could easily figure out what it does and how to modify after a quick sniff.
Well, that's not the case for this task.
Go and stick your hand elbow deep in this piece of garbage file so you can try to understand what it does and how to make it work.

You can use the [visualizer](https://irdkwmnsb.github.io/visualizer/turing-machine.html) to run the program.

## Solution
1) Reverse engineer the program based on it's behaviour or by semantics  
2) Rewrite it in C++  
3) Find the input that would result in an accepted state by trying all the combinations  
4) Profit  

Although it's slower, but it is also possible to find the accepting input tape by bruting in parallel.
